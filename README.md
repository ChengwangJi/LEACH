Low Energy Adaptive Clustering Hierarchy Protocol
An algorithm based on weighted coefficient is proposed to meet the need of wireless network.

The work has compared the current promising method to provide the more efficient algorithm, where the longer lifetime has been achieved based on the same power for each nodes in the WSN.
